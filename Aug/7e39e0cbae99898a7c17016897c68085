Promoter Found Dead After Exposing Mayweather-McGregor &#8216;Fake Fight&#8217; A boxing promoter who had been working on the upcoming Mayweather-McGregor bout, was found dead within hours of warning the fight is fixed. Barry Gibson was found dead in his hometown of Washington D.C. in what has the hallmarks of an execution-style killing, hours after blowing the lid on the Mayweather-McGregor fight backstage at a press conference in Toronto, Canada. Early reports claim the 45-year-old was found shot dead in his Jeep, along with one other man, believed to be a colleague. According to Gibson, Mayweather and McGregor have organized a &#8220;fixed fight&#8221; that will earn them both record pay packets and hundreds of millions for broadcasters, but will send jaded boxing fans home disappointed.
