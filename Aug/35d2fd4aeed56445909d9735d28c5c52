The confusion about which Tsekeleke died frustrates Tsekeleke's family&nbsp; There are two Tsekeleke's in South Africa. The original Tsekeleke being Anthony Motaung and the younger version of Tsekeleke being Mackson Tholo. Dr Malinga featured the young Tsekeleke in one of his music videos and at some point once told him to find a name more original. No one can blame the fans for getting confused as to which Tsekeleke died. The young Tsekeleke got furious when condolences kept rolling into his family instead of the Motaung family. He should have chosen a name more original indeed than stealing his icons identity. We understand he adores him but now he's confusing the fans and getting mad about it. Not everyone got confused but many were confused but the dust has settled now.
