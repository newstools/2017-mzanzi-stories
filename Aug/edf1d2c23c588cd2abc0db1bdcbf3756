Simphiwe Ngema:I dream of Dumi leading me to a man he wants me to marry It's almost a week since Dumi Masilela was buried. Dumi was a true believer and follower of God. He married the pastor's child and they are both strong believers. Simphiwe has been having the same dream ever since she laid her husband to rest. Simphiwe says Dumi appears to be very happy for me and the man in my dream. He keeps introducing me to him and telling me how much of a good man the man is. When I told Dumi's mom about the dream she then said it's a sign that Dumi wants me to marry that man . My heart refuses to accept but my mind tells that all Dumi wants is to see me happy.
