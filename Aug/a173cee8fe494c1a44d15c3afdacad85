The sandstorm has been identified as Dineo's daughter 'sarah' whom is said to be living with the pastor of Miracles pastor Mbhoro. The sandstorm has been living with the pastor after its mom who was in South Africa tormenting the world earlier this year left it. Pastor Mbhoro apparently is the one that found the abandoned daughter and kept it and now the daughter will be tormenting the world just like her mother did. Everyone is asked to stay indoors today from 3pm and everyone should avoid starting a fire . Motorists are also warned not to drive around that time late .
