7 Things Women Do While They Are Cheating In A Relationship #1 Asking about your daily routine This question isn&#8217;t strange for people who work away from home, but asking how your day went if you&#8217;re working at home is indeed unusual. If your girl is asking this question constantly, she might be planning to do something while you&#8217;re out. #2 She&#8217;s preoccupied with her thoughts If your girl is preoccupied with her thoughts and seems lost, she may be planning to break up with you. #3 Non-stop nagging If your girl nags you about every little thing without a reason, she is trying to find a reason for a break up. #4 Tagging an individual with &#8220;just a friend&#8221; Follow your girl&#8217;s reaction when you ask about her new friend. If she&#8217;s uneasy about it, trust us &#8211; there&#8217;s something going on. #5 Doesn&#8217;t give straight answers in a fight If she&#8217;s dodging questions or doesn&#8217;t give straight answers during a fight, she may be decided on a break up. #6 Hiding the cellphone from you If your girl hides her phone for you, there&#8217;s a chance there&#8217;s something in it you don&#8217;t need to see. #7 Not interested in romance If your girl is not as romantic as before, you&#8217;re probably being cheated on. It&#8217;s time to end the unhealthy relationship and move on. Do it for your own good.
