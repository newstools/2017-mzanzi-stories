President Zuma 'I'm chuck Norris, undefeated ' President Jacob Zuma says that people against him should just give up already because he is going now. My term will only end when it's the right time for it to end,he said. This thing of people trying to remove me because of their personal reasons will never work,he added. Apparently he compares himself to Chuck Norris, when and where did you ever seen him defeated? ANC is unshakeable, people can talk and say whatever but they will never shake the ANC, he said. He then thanked everyone who stood by him and remained loyal. He then closed of his chuck Norris speech by dancing and singing.
