Durban magosha causes traffic jam - this is serious THE sight of her n@_k3d punani draws customers like bees to honey. And while she knows her roadside advertising campaign is not popular with motorists, the magosha said she didn&#8217;t care.&#8220;They can complain all they like,&#8221; the p@_ntyl3ss woman told Mzansi Juice. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t going nowhere!&#8221; And the men who do visit her know pleasure is just a few moments away, behind the big trees right next to the road. MzansiJuice was alerted to the magosha&#8217;s shocking advertising by motorists who travel along the M4 going to Durban North from Durban CBD, North of Durban. &#8220;This is too much,&#8221; said a motorist who gave his name as Xolani Shezi (36). He said it&#8217;s difficult not to look as the woman&#8217;s pu_n@n! was on full display. &#8220;You cannot miss it.&#8221; A passerby, Mdu Hadebe (41), said: &#8220;She needs to find another place.&#8221; But the magosha was in no mood to move. &#8220;If my way of advertising doesn&#8217;t fit in with people, they should change their route. I won&#8217;t move.&#8221; Asked how she ended up being a magosha, she said hers was a difficult life. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find work because I never went to school. This was my last option.&#8221; Not all motorists were complaining, though. A man who gave his name as Linda Mzobe (49) said he enjoyed the view and it was the main reason he used the road.
