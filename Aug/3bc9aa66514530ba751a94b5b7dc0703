Oscar Pistorius back at Kalafong hospital after been raped 9 times in jail The South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius who got arrested for shooting and killing his girlfriend is believed to be f having a hard time. Oscar has apparently been in and out of hospital lately for being raped in jail. Our Paralympic athlete isn't having it easy. One nurse said that Oscar has been raped in the @nus and he's been bleeding while another said Oscar is faking it all. The second nurse said Oscar is just trying to find a way to get out of jail, so he figured acting sick will get him the ticket back to his freedom. The annoyed nurse added that he killed an innocent woman so he should just stay there and serve his sentence without disturbing us, she said. I became a nurse to help the sick not to nurse murderers,said the Atteridgeville based nurse.
