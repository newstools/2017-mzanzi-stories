Ganesh Chaturthi: How sweet! Salman Khan is the first guest at sister Arpita Khan Sharma&#8217;s residence for Ganesh Chaturthi Arpita Khan Sharma and Ayush Sharma bring in their Ganpati and guess who's their first visitor. It's brother Salman Khan! For all those unaware, unlike how usually the celebrations take place at Galaxy Apts, this year Arpita will be hosting the Ganpati celebrations at her new residence. Arpita Khan Sharma and Ayush Sharma bring in their Ganpati and guess who&#8217;s their first visitor. It&#8217;s brother&nbsp;Salman Khan! For all those&nbsp;unaware, unlike how usually the&nbsp;celebrations take place at Galaxy Apts, this year&nbsp;Arpita will be hosting the Ganpati celebrations at her new residence. On the same, she had quoted to DNA,&nbsp;&#8220;Actually, it becomes a little difficult for dad (Salim Khan) and mom (Salma Khan) because there are so many people coming in and they don&#8217;t get their space. For two days, there are people constantly in and out, and it&#8217;s a bit much for them. Last year, too, we talked about moving it out of Galaxy. This year we got this new house and so we decided to do the celebrations at our place.&#8221;&nbsp;And with the&nbsp;celebrations kickstarting, the first to visit&nbsp;the Khan house&#8217;s Ganpati was Salman. The actor recently&nbsp;returned from his Tiger Zinda Hai schedule. While he will be&nbsp;flying out yet again for the next&nbsp;schedule, for now he has come back to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. Our shutterbugs managed to grab clicks of the&nbsp;superstar leaving from his sister&#8217;s apartment last night. Perhaps he made a short visit to ensure that everything was sorted for the big day and that Arpita didn&#8217;t need any last minute changes. You see, she has been working on it for a while now. Since she is hosting the celebrations this year at her place, along with Ayush,&nbsp;Arpita hasn&#8217;t taken a break. In fact, even when she was in New York vacationing, she was&nbsp;making sure things&nbsp;are going steadily with the preps. The couple recently bought a house and it&#8217;s really special for Arpita as the lord will be gracing her house. She quoted to DNA, &#8220;When I&#8217;d decided to start keeping Ganpati, we didn&#8217;t know how long we would do so. It all just happened. Now after 14 years of celebrating it, it&#8217;s become a family function. We all look forward to celebrating it. I feel truly blessed to have Ganpati Bappa grace our new home with his presence first and then we will be moving in. Galaxy will always be blessed by Ganpati and the visarjan will be at Galaxy garden.&#8221; Although the celebrations are shifting to their new abode, everything else remains unchanged. It is still the family&#8217;s Ganpati. It&#8217;s still very much the entire family&#8217;s festival. Everyone&#8217;s going to be here. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s at a new destination. Salman bhai will also be coming for a day to be there with us.&#8221; These siblings sure and sweet! Stay tuned to this space for hot scoop and latest updates.
