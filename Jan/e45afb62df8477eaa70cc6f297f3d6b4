A video of a road rage incident involving a motorist assaulting a Durban taxi driver who is repeatedly asked if he thinks he &#8220;owns the road&#8221; has gone viral. In the video&#8218; posted by Amanda Eve Mseleku on Tuesday morning&#8218; the motorist is seen repeatedly punching a taxi driver who is seated in his minibus. &#8220;Jump out&#8218;&#8221; shouts the motorist. &gt; The video was recorded at the intersection of Botanic Gardens and King Dinizulu roads outside the Durban University of Technology &#8212; an informal taxi rank. A few seconds later&#8218; the driver tries to evade the beating by escaping through the passenger door&#8218; but his attacker follows him and continues to punch and kick the driver. The man swears at the driver&#8218; repeatedly asking him if he &#8220;owns the road?&#8220; Bystanders are seen watching the assault and no one intervenes to stop the assault. The video had been viewed more than 100 000 times by 7am on Thursday.
