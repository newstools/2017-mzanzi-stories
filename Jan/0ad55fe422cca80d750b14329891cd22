A man photographed driving with a woman inside a cage on the back of his bakkie has brushed off criticism&#8218; saying he was merely giving her a lift. A photograph of the Isuzu bakkie with Eastern Cape registration plates caused outrage when it was shared on social media on Thursday. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille entered the fray&#8218; urging officials to &#8220;investigate&#8218; arrest and charge if it is what it seems&#8221;. The picture first appeared on the &#8220;Oos-Kaap Plaaswerkers Opstand&#8221; (Eastern Cape Farmworkers Uprising) Facebook group &#8211; a movement by farm workers taking a stand and speaking out against injustices and often illegal labour practices. still persisting in this part of the farming sector. TMG Digital tracked down the owner of the vehicle&#8218; Johan Erasmus&#8218; who admitted to driving the bakkie&#8218; and said the woman wanted a lift from a farm outside Cradock in the Eastern Cape. She was apparently going to a clinic there. &#8220;She herself climbed into that thing and I dropped her off in Craddock&#8218;&#8221; said Erasmus. &#8220;This cage on the back of the bakkie is a sheep cage that we use to weigh lambs. The cage is loose&#8218; I tie it down with the straps and then I take it off and weigh lambs.&#8221; He said there was no space in the passenger seat for her. Zille posted in a tweet later that the owner of the vehicle had been found: &#8220;Emerging facts appear very serious. Police onto it.&#8221;
