ZUMA SAYS HE GOT THE SAME CHARACTER LIKE STEVE BIKO PRETORIA -&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma&nbsp;has likened himself to&nbsp;Steve Biko, saying the Black Consciousness leader was hated by some, much like himself. The President commemorated the 40th anniversary of Biko's murder on Tuesday by laying a wreath in his cell at the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre. Biko died at the then Pretoria Central Prison from injuries sustained while in police custody. President Zuma used an analogy likening himself to Biko. &#8220;We are still there some of us, hated as he was hated. At least he was hated and killed &#8211; it&#8217;s better with us we&#8217;re still hated and with words.&#8221; The President seemed to suggest that he&#8217;s made peace with this hatred. &#8220;But it is there; it is what we receive always from where we are, and so we&#8217;re not ashamed.&#8221; The President told his supporters at his 75th birthday party earlier this year that he is used to being criticised and being called names, saying it doesn't worry him anymore.
