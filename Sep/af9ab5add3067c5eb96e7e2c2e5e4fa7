VIDEO FOOTAGE EMERGES OF &#8216;CHILLIES BHENGU&#8217; WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY SAPS IN SHOOTOUT This is according to KwaZulu-Natal provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala. Sandile Eugene Bhengu, known as Chillies, was killed following a shootout with police in Chatsworth this week. Gwala confirmed to the Daily News that police are aware of a message circulating on social media warning of chaos in the Durban south township &nbsp;this weekend. &#8220;Although we are aware of this message on social media we are unaware of the source and its authenticity and therefore cannot comment if this threat is true. However, there is always a trend amongst criminals that if one of them dies, they spin vehicles and make threats to commit more crime,&#8221; said Gwala. She added that it was disappointing&nbsp;to law enforcement officers when they see communities coming out in large numbers to give criminals a &#8220;heroes send off&#8221;. &#8220;It is equally&nbsp;disappointing to the victims of these atrocious crimes who live with the trauma for the rest of their lives.&#8221;
