WATCH: &#8216;STRONG&#8217; MUGABE LOOKING SHAKY JUST a day after claiming that &#8220;my organs are still very strong&#8221; and that he&#8217;s &#8220;not going anywhere&#8221;, footage has emerged of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe looking very frail indeed. The Twitter clip was taken as Mugabe shakily makes his way up the steps onto the podium for a rally in Chinhoyi on Saturday. Watch the video below Amid cheers, the long-time Zimbabwe president appears to lean on an aide. He then sits gingerly down on a leather sofa as his wife Grace places his hat back on his head. He's then shown with his eyes closed and head nodding - though his officials will no doubt deny that he's dozing and insist he was just deep in thought. Previously his spokesperson has claimed Mugabe is merely resting his eyes, which are fragile after cataract operations. Tweeted Zimbabwe publisher Trevor Ncube: "This is heartbreaking. Why are they doing this to Mugabe?" At the rally Mugabe said doctors were amazed with his health. "I said it's through God's grace," Mugabe said. This is so heartbreaking. Why are they doing this to Mugabe. pic.twitter.com/O1OQbpRB36 &#8212; Trevor Ncube (@TrevorNcube) July 30, 2017
