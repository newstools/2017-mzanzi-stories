14-YEAR-OLD GIRL OBIAMAKA NGOZICHUKWU RAPED AND KILLED BY LAGOS AREA BOYS FOR REFUSING TO BE THEIR GIRLFRIEND According to Anambra state online Facebook page, Obiamaka was at home for the holidays when she met her untimely death. She was at home alone when some Indian Hemp smoking boys who had asked her out and she refused, scaled her family&#8217;s compound fence and gained access to their apartment in Abule Ado area of Lagos state. They raped her and left her in the pool of her own blood. Some residents living in the area who saw the boys as they scaled the fence out of the compound, alerted the mother of the deceased who returned home from her workplace immediately. She got home to find her 14 year old daughter with blood stains on her vagina and gasping for air. She rushed her to a hospital where she was pronounced dead. The distraught mother, Mrs Orakwue, told friends and family members who were on a condolence visit: &#8220;I was at work when I got a call from our neighbor that they saw some boys jumping out from the fence of our compound and that my daughter was not responding to the knock on the gate since it was locked from inside. I was worried because my daughter was the only one at home and her other siblings were on holidays at my elder brothers place in Lekki. &#8220;On getting to the house, I opened the gate with my spare key and dashed into the room only to find my daughter gasping for breath in the pool of her blood. I asked her what happened and all she could mutter was, Mummy&#8230;those boys I told you about&#8221;&#8230;,
