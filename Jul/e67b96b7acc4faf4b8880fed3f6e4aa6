Generations The Legacy &nbsp;- Smanga's real life fianc dumps him because their $&#8364;X life is boring With the Smanga character trending a lot of women watched with so much envy at Tshidi and Thabi. It got very crazy on social media when every girl wished their men had such drive and passion in b#d. Most women wrote about how he looks like he could give you enough lov!ng in b#d to last you decades to come. While men complained about how much their women expects the impossible from them between the sheets. Smanga's fiance wrote on her page that he is now a free man anyone who wants him can now feel free to get him. She later added how much he looks like he's enjoying it on TV but at home it's a total different story so she's tired of depriving her needs. Another woman pointed out that maybe the woman isn't as t@sty as Tshidi and Thabi so she shouldn't blame the tiger for her sourness.
