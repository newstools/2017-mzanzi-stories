Graca Marshel Mandela is furious and Nelson Mandela's Doctor and Mandela's children defend Doctor&nbsp; The wife of the late first black president says his late husband's memories are being dragged in the mud while his privacy is being invaded by the one person who was supposed to protect it. I'm sueing the Medi clinic heart hospital Doctor for not being professional. The Doctor is clearly breaking his Doctor-Patient confidentiality code,Graca said. Graca says the information in the book is disrespectful and sensitive but the Doctor and his publishing house saw the need to hang it for everyone to read. Graca is livid but the Doctor behind the book says that he spoke to Mandela's family before writing the book and they had no problem with the book,only Graca has a problem with the book.
